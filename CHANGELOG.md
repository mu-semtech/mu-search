# Changelog

**Features**
- Add query param to get exact count in search results
- Add filter flags :id: and :uri: to filter by id and URI
- Support wait interval less than 1 min in update handler

## v0.10.0-beta.3
- change: Use 1 construct query instead of 1 query per property to fetch properties for a document

## v0.10.0-beta.2
- fix: Use tagged base image of mu-jruby-template
- fix: re-add support for deletes in delta-handling
- fix: proper support for nested objects in delta handling (note still does not take the nested type into account)

## v0.10.0-beta.1
- change: put delta handling and lookups in a separate thread

## v0.9.0
- fix: Base image bumped to fix runtime warning (see issue [25](https://github.com/mu-semtech/mu-ruby-template/pull/25) on the mu-ruby-template)

## v0.9.0-beta.7
**Fixes**
-  fix escaping of values when handling delta's

## v0.9.0-beta.6
**Fixes**
- bump base image to properly listen to signals

## v0.9.0-beta.5
**Fixes**
- the admin endpoint to delete indexes should now work correctly ( https://github.com/mu-semtech/mu-search/issues/59 )
- search should no longer be blocked when a new index is created ( https://github.com/mu-semtech/mu-search/issues/42 )

## v0.9.0-beta.4
**Features**
-  changes how additive indexes work. search indexes defined in `eager_indexing_groups` can now partially match the user's allowed groups. Indexes will be combined at search time to fully match the incoming allowed groups. If no combination can be found a single index matching the user's allowed groups will be created. This also means additive indexes are no longer opt in, but given proper eager index definitions this should be fully backwards compatible.
- experimental support for indexing language strings

## v0.9.0-beta.3
**Fixes**
- match delta predicates in both directions
## v0.9.0-beta.2
**Fixes**
- fix handling deletion of a resource

**Features**

## v0.8.0-beta.4
**Features**
- Allow to specify wildcards and per-field boosts in fields parameter
- multi match support for fuzzy filter
